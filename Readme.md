### Explanation of the Approach for Filling Out the Google Form Using Selenium and Python:

The `GoogleFormPage` class is designed to encapsulate the methods required to interact with a Google Form. It is initialized with a Selenium WebDriver instance and the URL of the specific Google Form. This setup allows for easy navigation and interaction with the form elements.

The `open` method is straightforward, utilizing the WebDriver to navigate to the specified Google Form URL. This method ensures that the form is loaded and ready for interaction.

In the `fill_form` method, the process starts by taking a screenshot of the form before any data is entered. This initial screenshot serves as a reference point for the form's original state. The method then locates each form field using XPath locators, ensuring precise identification of the elements corresponding to name, contact number, email, address, pin code, date of birth, gender, and captcha. Once the fields are identified, the provided data is input into each respective field using the `send_keys` method. After populating the form, another screenshot is taken to capture the state of the form with the entered data. The submit button is then located and clicked directly, followed by a final screenshot to confirm the form's submission.

The `test_submit_google_form` function configures the WebDriver with options for headless operation, window size, and maximization, ensuring a controlled and consistent testing environment. An instance of `GoogleFormPage` is created within this function, which is then used to open the form and fill it with sample data. After the form is submitted, the WebDriver is closed, completing the test process.

This approach ensures a comprehensive and automated method for filling out and submitting a Google Form, with screenshots taken at key stages for verification or debugging purposes. The encapsulation of form interaction logic within the `GoogleFormPage` class promotes code reuse and clarity, making the script easy to understand and maintain.

**Screenshot Methods:** There are two methods employed for capturing screenshots during the form filling process. The first method captures a full webpage screenshot, which includes the entire content of the webpage but adds approximately 4 seconds to the overall execution time due to its comprehensive nature. Alternatively, window screenshots can be used, which capture only the visible portion of the webpage at any given time, potentially reducing execution time depending on the size and complexity of the webpage being tested.
